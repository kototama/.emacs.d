TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org-mode.

This is the command invoked in Org-mode by the TAB key.  Its main purpose
is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
in special contexts.

- When this function is called with a prefix argument, rotate the entire
  buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
  1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
  2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
  3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.
  When called with two `C-u C-u' prefixes, switch to the startup visibility,
  determined by the variable `org-startup-folded', and by any VISIBILITY
  properties in the buffer.
  When called with three `C-u C-u C-u' prefixed, show the entire buffer,
  including any drawers.

- When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.

- When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
  by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
  1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
  2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
               From this state, you can move to one of the children
               and zoom in further.
  3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
  If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.

- When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
  `org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation' is set, cycle the level
  of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
  speeds up creation document structure by pressing TAB once or several
  times right after creating a new headline.

- When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
  a `show-subtree' and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
  is negative, go up that many levels.

- When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
  binding for TAB, which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
  `org-cycle-emulate-tab' for details.

Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

This will let you select a template from `org-capture-templates', and then
file the newly captured information.  The text is immediately inserted
at the target location, and an indirect buffer is shown where you can
edit it.  Pressing \\[org-capture-finalize] brings you back to the previous state
of Emacs, so that you can continue your work.

When called interactively with a \\[universal-argument] prefix argument GOTO, don't capture
anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected template
stores its notes.  With a double prefix argument \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument], go to the last note
stored.

When called with a `C-0' (zero) prefix, insert a template at point.

ELisp programs can set KEYS to a string associated with a template
in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection
will be bypassed.

If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the
agenda will use the date at point as the default date.  Then, a
`C-1' prefix will tell the capture process to use the HH:MM time
of the day at point (if any) or the current HH:MM time.
